# input_type-Picker
JavaScript Class allowing end-users to pick/choose items from highly complex pop-up menus when using &lt;input&gt; tags

This is remotely similar to using a &lt;datalist&gt; but far more flexible and powerful.
  
Pop-up menus may have (virtually) any HTML content, and even may have additional user controls to display various developer-defined options.

This Class is the backbone of the MasterColorPicker project.  That project makes a great demo of this one:
